Need to be able to download the galaxy information and dark matter
halo information for the TNG300 and TNGCluster

Information that we will want:
  * spatial coordinates of the galaxies (x,y,z)
  * locations of the centers of the dark matter halos
  * luminosities of the galaxies (in the SDSS bandpasses g,r,i,z)
  * stellar masses of the galaxies (this is something that will need 
    to be calculated? Bryanne might be the best person to ask how
    to best define/use the stellar mass - my best guess is that
    we want to use SubhaloMassType)
  * radii of the galaxies

Important 1: need to remove any luminous objects that are flagged
as being "non cosmological in origin" (i.e., we don't want objects 
with Subhaloflag = 0)

Important 2: need to use the subhalo magnitudes from Nelson et al. (2018)
to assign luminosities to the galaxies because these include the effects
of dust obscuration and better approximate what we'd see in the real
universe (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey)

Important 3: need to correct the stellar masses of the galaxies following
Appendix A in Pillepich et al. (2018) because the stellar masses 
aren't as well converged in TNG300 as in the benchmark TNG100 simulation

Important 4: because the smoothing length used by the TNG300 is
different for z < 1 and z >= 1 we'll likely want to adopt a minimum 
size for the galaxies we want to use following Curtis et al. (2026)
(note: we need to check to see if TNGCluster used the same 
smoothing length change as TNG300)

We will want catalogs for timesteps corresponding to the following
redshifts:
  * 0.0
  * 0.1
  * 0.2
  * 0.3
  * 0.4
  * 0.5
  * 0.7
  * 1.0
  * 1.5
  * 2.0
  * 3.0

What are we going to study?
  * ideally, all objects with virial masses >= 10^{13} solar masses,
    but we may run into challenges with objects with masses
    < 10^{14} solar masses having more than one dominant galaxy
    (like the Milky Way and Andromeda in our Local Group); this 
    is why we want to know the location of the center of each
    dark matter halo -- the dominant galaxy (or galaxies) may
    be offset from the center of the dark matter halo
  * we will want to use "Group_M_Crit200" to define the masses
    of the groups/clusters; note that these are given in units
    of 10^{10} M_sun/h

First step after downloading the appropriate catalogs:
  * for all objects of interest, translate the coordinates in "code"
    coordinates to a center of mass coordinate system where the
    central, dominant galaxy is defined to be located at (0,0,0)
  * assess the degree to which the central, dominant galaxy is
    offset from the center of the dark matter halo as a function 
    of the mass of system (i.e., compute offsets in 3D between 
    the GroupCM and the SubhaloCM for GroupFirstSub)
  * note: to translate the coordinates of the galaxies into 
    a center of mass coordinate system, it will be important to
    take the periodic boundary conditions into account
